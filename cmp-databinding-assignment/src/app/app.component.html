        <li>Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even</li>
        <li>The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game</li>
        <li>When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())</li>
        <li>The event should be listenable from outside the component</li>
        <li>When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))</li>
        <li>A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)</li>
        <li>Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components</li>
        <li>Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components</li>
